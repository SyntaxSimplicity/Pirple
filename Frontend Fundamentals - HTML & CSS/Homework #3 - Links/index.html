Homework Assignment #3: Links

Details:
 
It's time to compare your recipe to the recipes of others. Find the 5 best recipes for your dish from around the web. 
Now, add a list to the bottom of your document that links to each of those recipes.


Extra Credit:

So far your page is fairly unstructured (just lists, paragraphs and one title). 
Spruce it up a little by adding section-headings and extra elements to make the recipe more helpful to your readers. 
Get creative, add any elements you feel would help the user really understand the recipe and the dish itself.

    <a href="https://www.myrecipes.com/recipe/lemon-potato-salad-bites" target="_blank"><img src="./Resources/images/5.jpg" alt="Lemon Potato Salad Bites" /></a>
	<p>
        This is a great appetizer. It is more a mini stuffed baked potato instead if a potato salad.<br />
		Transports well to a party in a mini muffin pan. It comes from a Cooking Light issue. <br />
		Many of the ingredients could be changed for variety.<br />

        and i like this dish because it looks simple and tasty at the same time.
